Transient keyword :

Transient is a variables modifier used in serialization. At the time of serialization, if we don’t want to save value of a particular variable 
in a file, then we use transient keyword. When JVM comes across transient keyword, it ignores original value of the variable and save default 
value of that variable data type.

Practically we serialized only those fields which represent a state of instance, after all serialization is all about to save state of an object
 to a file. It is good habit to use transient keyword with private confidential fields of a class during serialization.
 
 
 FOR EXAMPLE:--
 
 class Test implements Serializable
{
    private transient String password;
 
    transient int age;
  
    private String username, email;
    Date dob;
  
}
