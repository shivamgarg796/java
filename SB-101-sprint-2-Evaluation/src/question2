 ACID PROPERTIES:
 Atomicity:-The entire transaction takes place at once or does not happen at all.
 
 Consistency:The Database must be consistent before and after the transaction hapeens.
 
 Isolation:Multiple transaction occurs independently without intereferences.
 
 Durability:The changes of a succesful transaction occures even idf the system fails to acv=hieve the results.\
