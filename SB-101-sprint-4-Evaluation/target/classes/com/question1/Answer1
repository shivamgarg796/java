What are the advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC?

Answer:-
#JDBC is the core technology. and hibernate is the implementation and the software framework.

#In JDBC we can not store a java object into the table.but in hybernate we can.

#In hybernate we don not have a boiler plate code problem.it means that in JDBC we have to write same code again and again
in multiple classes.

#In hybernate we can not handle any type of checked or unchecked exceptions.but in Jdbc we have to manage a lots of exception.
