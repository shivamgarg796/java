An Unwanted event occured at during the execution of the progragram is known as Exception.

Exception is of two types :-

Checked Exception :-
# Checked exception occurs at compile time.

# checked exceptions can be handled at compile time.
# checked exceptions are directly child of exception class.

package com.masai

public class MyException extends Exception{
	public MyException(message){
	super(message);
}

Unchecked Exceptions:-
# Unchecked exception occurs at run time.
# compiler doesn't checked the checked exceptions.it ignores that.
# Unchecked exceptions can not be handled at compile time.because they generate by logical mistakes in the program.
# Unchecked exceptions are directly child of RunTimeException class.
#example:-NullPointer Exceptions, Arithmetic Exceptions, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundExceptions.

package com.masai

public class MyException extends RunTimeException{
	public MyException(message){
	super(message);
}
