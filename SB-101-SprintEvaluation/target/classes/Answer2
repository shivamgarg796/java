● Explain @Cascade and @mappedBy annotations:
● What is ORM in Hibernate?

Answer:-A

@Cascade :-It is the annotation in hybernate ORM, when we perform some operations on the entity class with the help of this the same action 
will be apply to the asscociated entity of that class.

Cascade Type:
#ALL
#REMOVE  


@mappedBy :-This annotation is used to make this asscociation bidirectional,we have to define the referencing side. The reference side simply
maps to the owning side then we can use mappedBy annotation attribute with @OneToMany annotation.with this we established a bidirectional 
association between one entity and other asscociates. 



Answer :-B

ORM stands for object Relational mapping is a paradigm to convert data between relational database and object orinted programing languages.

when we work with an object oriented system ,there is a many mismatch between the object model and relational database model.

#granularity mismatch :- HAS-A relationship problem

#Inheritence mismatch :- IS-A relationship problem

#Association Mismatch :- Table relationship problem

With the use of hybernate software framework we can easily write applications whose data outlives the application process.

As an ORM framework,hybernate is concerned with data JPA as it applies to relational database via java database connectivity.
