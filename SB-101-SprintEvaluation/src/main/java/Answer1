What is lazy loading and eager loading in hibernate?

Answer:---By default ORM software perform lazy loading while fetching the objs.

# when we fetch the parent object,then only the first level object related data will be loaded into the memory,
but the second level  object related data will be loaded at time of calling the Second level object related methods. it is known as lazy
loading.

but if we want the second level object related data will be loaded at the time of when first level object will loaded into the memory 
then we have to use "@ElementCollection(fetch=FetchType.EAGER" annotation to acheive Eager loading.This is known as eager loading.
