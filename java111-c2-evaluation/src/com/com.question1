Difference between IS-A and Has-A relationship

Answer:-IS-A relationship is achived by created  by an object of childclass.

#reference to inheritance or implementation.

#expressed using keyword extend

example:-Class A extends B
A a = new B().

HAS-A

#HAS-A relationship is accesed by declaring by an instance variable of object type in any other class.

#there is no specific keyword to represent HAS-A relationship but mostly we are dependent on new keyword.

#main advantage by of Has-A relationship to access any class by declaring an instace.

#example:-

class A{

 int x=10;
 B b;

}

class B{

}  

ACCESS MODIFIER:

#public :-the scope of this modifier if we can declare any class ,method ,variables as public then we can access these members from 
everyehere means that with in the class or outside the package also.

#private:-the scope of this modifier if we can declare any class ,method ,variables as private then we can access these members in the  
class only not outside the package .

#protected:-the scope of this modifier if we can declare any class ,method ,variables as protected then we can access these members in the  
class or with in the package only and if we want to acess this class member outside the class or outside the package yes it is possible the both
classes are in Is-A relationship is mandatory.

#default:-the scope of this modifier if we can not declare any class ,method ,variables as private ,public and protected  then it will 
considered as a default.we can access these members in the class or with in the package only.
