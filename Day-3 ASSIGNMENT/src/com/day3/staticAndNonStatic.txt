Static variable	

#Static variables can be accessed using class name	
#Static variables can be accessed by static and non static methods	
#Static variables reduce the amount of memory used by a program.
#Static variables are shared among all instances of a class.
#Static variable is like a global variable and is available to all methods.	

example of static variable:--

package com.masai;
public class Student{

 static int a=5;

static void print(){
 	System.out.println(a);
	}

public static void main(String[] args){
	Student.print();	
}
}




Non static variable

#Non static variables can be accessed using instance of a class
#Non static variables cannot be accessed inside a static method.
#Non static variables do not reduce the amount of memory used by a program.
#Non static variables are specific to that instance of a class.
#Non static variable is like a local variable and they can be accessed through only instance of a class.

example of non-static variable:--

package com.masai;
public class Student{

 int a=5;

public void print(){
 	System.out.println(a);
	}

public static void main(String[] args){
	Student s=new Student();	
	s.print();	
}
}
